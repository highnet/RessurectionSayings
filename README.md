# Ressurection Sayings

A World of Warcraft TBC Classic Anniversary addon that automatically announces a random, class-aware quip in chat whenever you resurrect another player.

> **Game Version:** TBC Classic Anniversary — Interface 20504 (patch 2.4.3 / 2.5.4)  
> **Addon Version:** 3.0.0  
> **SavedVariables:** `RessurectionSayingsDB`

---

## Features

- Triggers on **cast start** of any resurrection spell, capturing the target before they release.
- Chooses a saying from the **target's class pool** — Warriors get warrior jokes, Paladins get bubble jokes, and so on.
- **Built-in sayings per class** (All classes covered).
- **`{name}` substitution** — every saying can include `{name}`, which is replaced with the target player's name at cast time.
- **Fully editable** via a GUI options panel — edit, add, or remove individual sayings per class without touching any files.
- At least one saying per class is always enforced — the last remaining saying cannot be deleted.
- Output channel is configurable: `/say`, `/emote`, or local chat frame only.
- Per-character profile storage via AceDB-3.0.

## Customising Sayings

Sayings support the `{name}` placeholder, which is replaced with the target's name at cast time:

```
Rise, {name}! Your rage bar missed you.
→  Rise, Gornak! Your rage bar missed you.
```

Custom sayings are stored per-profile in `RessurectionSayingsDB` (SavedVariables). Resetting a class to defaults removes your overrides and restores the built-in list.

## Development Notes

- **Event:** `UNIT_SPELLCAST_START` — fires the moment the cast begins.  The target is still selected at this point, so `UnitName("target")` and `UnitClass("target")` reliably capture the correct player.
- **DB key:** `RS.db.profile.classSayings[classFile]` — `nil` means "use built-ins"; `{}` (empty table) means "user cleared all sayings" (not the same as nil).
- **Pool compaction:** `SetClassSaying(classFile, idx, "")` removes the entry at `idx` and compacts the array — there are never holes in the pool.
- **UI refresh:** `AceConfigRegistry-3.0:NotifyChange` is called after every `execute` button mutation (Remove, Reset, Add) to force the options panel to repaint.
- **Minimum pool size:** The `Remove` button is disabled and `SetClassSaying` refuses the operation when only one saying remains, guaranteeing the pool is never empty.
